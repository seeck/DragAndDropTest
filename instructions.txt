You start with a Unity project with a standard script that allows for dragging and dropping of list items to other lists. 

There's a Main.unity scene in Assets/Scenes that contains five lists that are all drop zones for ListEntry objects.



Please modify the project to implement the following rules for drag and drop. Feel free to add or modify code, the scene, as well as the prefabs if necessary.



- there are two types of lists: Main lists (Media, Contacts) and Quick Access lists (Shortcuts, Playlist, Trash)

- only Songs can be dropped into Playlist. Moving songs to the playlist creates a shortcut to the song in the playlist

- songs and contacts can be dropped from anywhere into shortcuts, creating shortcuts

- when shortcuts are created, the original item remains in the list it was dragged from

- dragging an item from Media or Contacts to the "Trash" will remove the item and all shortcuts to it

- There shall be no duplicate items in any of the lists, except the playlist (we might want to listen to the same song twice)

- dragging an item from a Quick access list into the trash will remove the (1) shortcut in that list, but not the original item in the Media or contacts list

- BONUS: dragging a song onto a contact will print "Shared song (song name) with contact (contact name) in the console



Please try to be as efficient as possible. Please wrap up your investigation after two to three hours and document your changes (ideally, send a git repository with change history).


Good luck!
